#This notebook demonstrates the following key aspects:

    Loading and inspecting the data
    Data cleaning and transformation
    Feature engineering and extraction
    Data splitting into training and testing sets
    Model training using various machine learning algorithms
    Model evaluation and comparison
    Visualizing model performance metrics


    Import necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and others.
    Load the dataset from a CSV file and inspect its initial structure and content.
    Display summary statistics and information about the data.

#Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering

    Handle missing values and impute them using appropriate strategies such as median imputation for numeric columns and mode imputation for object columns.
    Replace "No Info" values with NaN for consistency.
    Apply transformations such as logarithmic transformation to handle outliers and normalize data.
    Encode categorical variables using ordinal encoding.
    Perform additional feature engineering tasks such as transforming column values, splitting columns, and creating new features.

#Data Splitting and Model Training

    Split the data into training and testing sets.
    Train multiple machine learning models, such as XGBoost, Gradient Boosting Classifier, AdaBoost Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier, on the training data.
    Predict the dependent variable using the trained models on the testing data.

#Model Evaluation and Visualization

    Evaluate the performance of each model using various metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix, and AUC.
    Compare the models' performance using bar plots.
    Visualize the confusion matrix and other evaluation metrics for each model.
